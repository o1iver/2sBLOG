2sBLOG

## Description:
Super simple file based blog.



## Usage:
Add blog posts as individual files to posts/ numbering them in increasing order (that is how they will be ordered on the blog).

All output comes out as is, including html code. The only thing that gets parsed are links. The format for these is:
[link]this is the link text, http://thisistheurl.com[/link]

There are four config values to set at the start of index.php (site_name, site_url, site_author, site_author_email).

Note that there is no commenting system or anything like that. It is a pure text output blog...

And thats all!
